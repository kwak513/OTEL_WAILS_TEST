# OpenTelemetry (OTEL) Monitoring System Demo

## 📢 Introduction
This project is a monitoring application designed to visualize the **three pillars of observability**: Metrics, Traces, and Logs. By integrating with the SigNoz API, this tool provides a centralized dashboard to monitor system health and performance.

## 📌 Key Features
### 1. SigNoz API Integration
- Connects to SigNoz to fetch observability data using a user-provided API key.

### 2. Metrics, Traces, and Logs Monitoring
- Metrics: Displays metric names, descriptions, and types in a table.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Execution)
Follow these steps to set up the full observability stack, including the Spring Boot instrumentation and the SigNoz backend.

### 1. Spring Boot Application Setup
To collect data, you must attach the OpenTelemetry Javaagent to your target Spring Boot application.

1. Download the Javaagent
- Download opentelemetry-javaagent.jar from the [Official OpenTelemetry Repo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).
- Place the .jar file in your Spring Boot project's root directory.

2. Configure VM Options
- In your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ), add the following to your Edit Configurations > VM Options

```
-javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar
-Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=http://localhost:4317
-Dotel.exporter.otlp.protocol=grpc
-Dotel.resource.attributes=service.name=demo-for-signoz1  # Set your service name
-Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp
```

### 2. Run SigNoz via Docker
SigNoz acts as the backend to store and process your OTel data.

1. Start Docker Desktop
2. Clone and Launch SigNoz:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone -b main https://github.com/SigNoz/signoz.git
cd signoz/deploy/docker

# Start SigNoz containers
docker-compose up -d --remove-orphans
```
The SigNoz dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### 3. Run OTEL_WAILS_DEMO
Once your Spring Boot app and SigNoz are running, launch this dashboard.

1. Clone and Run

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/kwak513/OTEL_WAILS_DEMO.git
cd OTEL_WAILS_DEMO

# Run in development mode
wails dev
```

2. Connect
- Copy your SigNoz API Key from [SigNoz API Key Setting Page](http://localhost:8080/settings/api-keys).
- Paste it into the API Key tab of this app to start monitoring.
